            The CCTV script answers the question of who would be in view or who wouldn't be in view of 'IC' cameras
            the CCTV system will be replacing any interior IC cameras to ensure fairness.
            CCTVs have blindspots and capture video only from different angles.
            There's 360 cameras that can be manned by the player
